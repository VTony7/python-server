# A sample package for security tool evaluation.

This is a python script and deployed in the docker image.
Listen tcp/9999 and execute "ls" via subprocess with the received string from the port.
The client sees the output of the process from "ls" + the string.

$ docker run -tp 9999:9999 --rm python-server

The container waits for tcp 9999.

At another window, a client sends a string for the argument of the "ls" and sees the output.

$ telnet localhost 9999
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Input (a) name(s) of file/directory => /
....

This has the typically command injection vulnerability (and so on).


Command injection:
Input (a) name(s) of file/directory => /; cat /etc/passwd
